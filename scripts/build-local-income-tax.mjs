 *
 * Only about ten states permit local income taxes, but where they exist they
 * are large enough to change a relocation decision — New York City adds nearly
 * 3.9% on top of New York State. Capturing that is the main reason this app
 * works at metro rather than state level (PROJECT.md D1).
 *
 * COVERAGE, STATED PLAINLY
 *
 *   Explicit, city-specific:  New York City, Yonkers, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh,
 *                             Detroit, Columbus, Cincinnati, Cleveland,
 *                             Louisville, Kansas City, St. Louis, Baltimore,
 *                             and Portland twice — Multnomah County's preschool
 *                             tax and the Metro housing tax
 *   Per county, weighted:     every Indiana metro, by population; Maryland's
 *                             statewide average, from its counties' 2026 rates
 *   State-average fallback:   AL, IA, KY, MI, MO, OH, OR, PA — the smaller
 *                             cities, where an average is much closer to right
 *
 * The fallback uses Tax Foundation's average effective local rate as a share
 * of AGI for that state, charged on gross pay as the nearest thing to AGI.
 * That is accurate where local rates are uniform and badly wrong for
 * concentrated high-rate cities — Philadelphia levies 3.74% against a
 * Pennsylvania average of 0.99%. Maryland left it because its counties tax
 * Maryland taxable income, and an AGI-share rate on that base takes the
 * deduction off twice; see MARYLAND_COUNTIES.
 *
 * Every city rate here is transcribed from that city's own revenue department
 * or, for New York City and Yonkers, from the state form that carries the
 * city's schedule, and every one of them records its source URL. A remembered rate is worse than an average,
 * because it looks sourced; where a rate could not be verified against a
 * primary source it is deliberately still on the average, and listed under
 * `limitations`.
 *
 * THE NEW YORK CITY PROBLEM
 *
 * The New York-Newark-Jersey City metro spans 22 counties across three states.
 * Only residents of the five boroughs pay New York City income tax. A single
 * metro-wide rate would be wrong for everybody — too high for Westchester, too
 * low for Brooklyn. So NYC and Yonkers are modelled as OPTIONAL jurisdictions
 * the user confirms, rather than being applied blindly to the whole metro.

/**
 * Portland is the awkward one, and it is worth spelling out why.
 *
 * Two separate taxes overlap. Metro's Supportive Housing Services tax covers
 * the whole Metro district — parts of Multnomah, Washington and Clackamas
 * counties. Multnomah County's Preschool for All tax covers Multnomah County
 * only. A Portland resident pays BOTH; someone in Beaverton pays only the
 * first; someone outside the district pays neither.
 *
 * Both are bracketed rather than flat, and the brackets are the important part:
 * below $125,000 single or $200,000 joint, neither is owed at all. Modelling
 * Portland on Oregon's 0.18% state average charged everyone in the metro a
 * little and the people who actually owe these taxes far too little.
 *
 * Two caveats, both stated on the data page. The thresholds are inflation
 * adjusted from tax year 2026 and the adjusted figures were not published in
 * a form that could be sourced here, so these are the legislated base amounts.
 * And both taxes are levied on Oregon TAXABLE income while this applies them
 * to gross, which pulls a household just above a threshold in slightly early.
 */
/*
 * THE RATES HERE WERE A FULL POINT TOO HIGH, and Portland is expensive enough
 * that a wrong local rate is worth more than most state errors.
 *
 * We charged 2.5% and 4%. Multnomah County and the Portland Revenue Division —
 * the office that actually administers the tax — both say, word for word:
 * "1.5% on Multnomah County taxable income over $125,000 for individuals or
 * $200,000 for joint filers, and an additional 1.5%" above $250,000 and
 * $400,000. So 1.5% then 3%, not 2.5% then 4%.
 *
 * A single filer on $300,000 was being charged $5,125 against a true $3,375 —
 * $1,750 a year too much, on top of everything else Portland costs.
 *
 * The thresholds are NOT indexed, unlike the Metro tax below. The rate rises
 * by 0.8 points later, to 2.3% and 3.8%, thresholds unchanged — in 2027 by
 * multco.us, in 2028 by portland.gov (checked 2026-10-01; the two disagree).
 * Tax year 2026 is unaffected either way.
 *
 * A HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD IS ON THE JOINT THRESHOLDS, exactly as with the Metro
 * tax below. The Portland Revenue Division, which administers both taxes,
 * lists head of household among the "joint" filing statuses for Preschool for
 * All as well as for SHS (https://www.portland.gov/revenue/personal-tax,
 * checked 2026-10-01). This carried no head-of-household schedule, so the
 * engine fell back to the single one: a single parent with $220,000 of Oregon
 * taxable income was charged $1,425 a year where the county asks $300.

 * INDIANA'S COUNTY INCOME TAX, per metro.
 *
 * This was the largest single error in the dataset. Indiana was carrying the
 * state-average local rate of 0.35%, which is not merely low — it is below
 * the LOWEST county in the state. Porter County, the cheapest of the 92,
 * charges 0.50%; Randolph charges 3.00%. The population-weighted statewide
 * average is 1.7536%. We were understating Indiana tax by over $1,000 a year
 * and making the state look cheaper than it is, which is the direction that
 * sends somebody to the wrong city.
 *
 * WEIGHTED BY POPULATION, NOT TAKEN FROM THE PRINCIPAL COUNTY. Indiana taxes
 * by county of residence and a metro spans several counties, so a single
 * headline county would misrepresent most of the people in it. The Indiana
 * side of Chicago makes the case: Porter charges 0.50% and Jasper 2.8640%, a
 * spread of nearly six times, and Lake and Porter are both central so there is
 * no obvious principal county to pick. Indianapolis runs from Hamilton's
 * 1.10% to Morgan's 2.72%, and Marion — 45% of the metro — is not enough of it
 * for its 2.02% to stand in for the metro's 1.81%.
 *
 * Rates: Departmental Notice #1, effective 1 January 2026, cross-checked
 * against the rate chart printed on Schedule CT-40 for the prior year — the
 * two agree on 86 of 92 counties, and the six that differ are exactly the six
 * the notice flags as changed. Populations: Census Vintage 2025 estimates.
 *
 * ONE THING THIS CANNOT SEE. Indiana fixes your county on 1 January and does
 * not change it when you move, so somebody who moves INTO Indiana during the
 * year owes no county tax at all in year one unless they were already working
 * there on 1 January. This charges them from day one, which overstates their
 * first year — the safe direction, and noted.

An individual county may be well above or below it — the state ranges from 0.50% to 3.00%.

/**
 * MARYLAND'S COUNTY INCOME TAX, county by county.
 *
 * Maryland was on Tax Foundation's 2.40% average, charged on gross pay. Two
 * things were wrong with that, and fixing either alone would have made it
 * worse.
 *
 * THE BASE. Maryland's counties tax Maryland TAXABLE income — "Local tax is
 * based on taxable income and not on Maryland state tax", in the
 * Comptroller's own withholding facts below — not the whole paycheque. So the
 * county rate goes on the same figure the state rate does, after the
 * deduction and exemptions, the way Indiana's counties already did.
 *
 * THE RATE. Tax Foundation's 2.40% is an effective rate "expressed as a
 * percentage of AGI" (footnote (a), in the source snapshot). That is already
 * net of Maryland's deduction and exemptions: it is the county rates, around
 * 3.1%, spread across a broader base. Moving it onto taxable income without
 * changing it would have taken those allowances off twice. So the average is
 * rebuilt from what the counties actually levy, weighted by population, the
 * same method Indiana's counties use.
 *
 * Rates: Comptroller of Maryland, "Withholding Tax Facts, January 2026 -
 * December 2026", COUNTY RATES. Every county is between 2.25% (Worcester) and
 * 3.30% (Dorchester, Kent).
 *
 * TWO COUNTIES ARE GRADUATED, and carry one rate here. Anne Arundel charges
 * 2.70% on the first $50,000 of taxable income ($75,000 joint), 2.94% to
 * $400,000 ($480,000) and 3.20% above. Frederick charges 2.25% to $25,000,
 * 2.75% to $50,000 ($100,000 joint), 2.96% to $150,000 ($250,000) and 3.20%
 * above. Each carries its middle band, which is where most of the people the
 * calculator is used for have their top dollar; a household near either end
 * is off by at most about a quarter of a point.
 *
 * Populations: Census ACS 2024 5-year estimates, table B01003, Maryland
 * counties (api.census.gov/data/2024/acs/acs5, retrieved 2026-10-01). They
 * only set the weights, so a year's drift in them moves an average by a
 * hundredth of a point at most.
