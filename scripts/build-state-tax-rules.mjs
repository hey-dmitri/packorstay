/**
 * Builds data/<version>/states.json from a committed snapshot of the
 * Tax Foundation state income tax table.
 *
 *   node scripts/build-state-tax-rules.mjs
 *
 * The snapshot lives in data/<version>/sources/ so this is fully reproducible
 * offline and the dataset can never change underneath a shared link.
 *
 * Tax Foundation content is CC BY-NC 4.0. This project is permanently
 * non-commercial (PROJECT.md section 1), so that licence is satisfied.
 * Attribution appears on the methodology page.
 *
 * KNOWN MODELLING DECISIONS — all deliberate, all disclosed:
 *
 *  1. Washington's 7%/9% applies to CAPITAL GAINS ONLY (source footnote tt).
 *     It is NOT a wage tax. Washington is therefore treated as having no wage
 *     income tax, alongside AK, FL, NV, NH, SD, TN, TX and WY.
 *
 *  2. Seven states levy their first positive rate above $0, leaving a
 *     zero-rate band below it. A {from: 0, rate: 0} bracket is prepended so
 *     every schedule starts at zero, as the engine requires.
 *
 *  3. The source publishes single and married-filing-jointly schedules only.
 *     Married-filing-separately and head-of-household are mapped to the single
 *     schedule. This is correct for MFS in most states and a documented
 *     approximation for head of household.
 *
 *  4. Some states express personal/dependent allowances as tax CREDITS rather
 *     than income exemptions. These are captured separately, because a credit
 *     reduces tax while an exemption reduces taxable income.
 *
 *  5. Income-based phase-outs of deductions, exemptions and credits (roughly a
 *     dozen states) are NOT modelled. They bite mainly at high incomes. Each
 *     affected state carries the source footnote so the limitation is visible
 *     on the methodology page.

/**
 * STATES WHOSE RATES AND ALLOWANCES HAVE BEEN READ OFF THE STATE'S OWN 2026
 * PUBLICATION, rather than taken on trust from the aggregated table.

 * This is a different and stronger claim than the head-of-household table
 * below, which mostly settled one question — which schedule and allowance a
 * single parent gets. This one means somebody opened the state's rate
 * schedule, withholding guide or statute for tax year 2026 and compared every
 * bracket and every allowance against what we ship.
 *
 * It exists because the aggregated table is published once a year, in
 * February, and states legislate through the spring. Seven moved underneath it
 * in 2026. "Our source is reputable" is not an answer to that; only looking is.
 *
 * `matched: true` means the state's own publication agreed with the table and
 * nothing needed changing. That is the most common and least interesting
 * result, and it is recorded precisely because "checked and agreed" is
 * indistinguishable from "never looked" unless somebody writes it down.

/**
 * STATES THAT TAX A MARRIED COUPLE AS TWO SINGLE FILERS on half the income
 * each, rather than as one joint return.
 *
 * MISSOURI IS THE REASON THIS IS A CORRECTNESS FIX RATHER THAN AN
 * OPTIMISATION: "Missouri law requires a combined return for married couples
 * filing together." It never performs a joint computation at all, so a
 * one-pass engine overcharged every two-earner couple in the state.
 *
 * Elsewhere it is an election, and one nearly every two-earner couple makes.
 * Delaware, Washington DC and Arkansas each run ONE rate ladder for every
 * filing status, so a couple climbs it twice as fast unless they split.
 * Kentucky's reason is different: its standard deduction is not doubled on a
 * joint return, so splitting is the only way to get two of them. Mississippi's
 * is different again — each spouse gets their own $10,000 band at 0%.
 *
 * Saving at $150,000 split evenly, per the states' own forms:
 *   DC $1,600 · DE $1,017 · AR $749 · MS $400 · MO $176 · KY $118
 *
 * DELIBERATELY ABSENT, each checked: Iowa, Montana, Georgia, Ohio and Alabama
 * all require the state status to match the federal one and double every
 * bracket and allowance, so splitting gains nothing. Virginia's version is not
 * a filing status at all — its Form 760 dropped status 4, and the same benefit
 * arrives as a "spouse tax adjustment" credit capped at $259, which is not
 * modelled.
 */
/**
 * PROPERTY TAX RELIEF THAT IS NOT ITEMISING.
 *
 * New Jersey is the only one, and it is the only relief in this dataset that
 * reaches a RENTER. New Jersey has no standard deduction, no itemised
 * deductions and no mortgage interest deduction at all — but it takes up to
 * $15,000 of property tax off taxable income, and counts 18% of a year's rent
 * as property tax for the purpose.
 *
 * New Jersey has the highest property taxes in the country, so this touches
 * nearly every household there. We modelled none of it.

 * The $50 credit is an ALTERNATIVE, not an addition — the return works both

 *
 * TABLE C, the "2% tax rate phase-out add-back", claws back the benefit of
 * Connecticut's lowest bracket. Its maximum is exactly that benefit: $10,000
 * of income at 2% instead of 4.5% is $250 for a single filer, $500 for a
 * couple on $20,000, $400 for a head of household on $16,000. That the caps

 * taxable income. The state publishes its own Schedule Z. Maryland sends them
 * to the JOINT schedule outright. Nobody had looked.
 *
 * Each entry below was read from the state's own revenue department, and the

 * MANDATORY EMPLOYEE PAYROLL CONTRIBUTIONS.

 * ALL wages with no ceiling at all, which is $1,300 a year at $100,000 and
 * $3,900 at $300,000. Every Californian on this site was shown that money as
 * theirs to spend.
 *
 * Rates are the 2026 EMPLOYEE share. Several programmes split the cost with the
 * employer and the split varies with headcount; where it does, the figure here
 * is the employee share at a normal-sized employer, which is what a person
 * reading a payslip will see.
 *
 * DEDUCTIBLE ONES ARE MARKED. The IRS treats mandatory contributions to the
 * California, New Jersey and New York disability funds, the Rhode Island
 * temporary disability fund and the Washington supplemental workers'
 * compensation fund as state income tax for Schedule A. The newer paid-leave
 * programmes have no such ruling, so they are not claimed as deductible —
 * understating a deduction is the safe direction.
 *
 * Maine and Delaware are deliberately absent: their employee share exists only
 * if the employer elects to split the cost, so there is no figure that is true
 * for everyone. DC's programme is employer-funded entirely.

/**
 * STATE ITEMISED DEDUCTIONS.
 *
 * The engine always applied the state STANDARD deduction, even though it
 * already knew the reader's property tax and mortgage interest. California and
 * New York both let you itemise on the state return whether or not you itemised
 * federally, and California's rules are far more generous than the federal ones:
 *
 *   - No SALT cap. California explicitly does not conform to OBBBA's
 *     "increased limitation on individual deductions for certain state and
 *     local taxes" — Schedule CA (540) instructions, "What's New".
 *   - Mortgage interest on acquisition debt up to $1,000,000, not $750,000.
 *     FTB's own deductions page states both figures side by side.
 *
 * On a San Jose buyer at $300,000 the two together are worth roughly $6,600 of
 * California tax.
 *
 * WHAT IS DEDUCTED HERE is only what this engine actually knows: property tax
 * and mortgage interest. A real Schedule CA also carries charitable giving,
 * medical costs above 7.5% of income and miscellaneous deductions above 2% —
 * none of which this site asks about. So the figure is a floor, and a reader
 * with those will do better than it says.
 *
 * STATE INCOME TAX IS NOT DEDUCTED. California requires it subtracted on
 * Schedule CA; you cannot deduct California tax from California income.
 *
 * California's high-income reduction — the lesser of 6% of income above about
 * $252,000 or 80% of the deductions — IS applied. What is still missing there
 * is the separate cut to its exemption CREDITS, which shares the same income
 * thresholds and is a different rule; California's own note says so.
 *
 * Fourteen states are populated. Every other state keeps the standard deduction
 * until its own rules have been read, which is the same honesty rule the
 * head-of-household table uses.

/**
 * STATE EARNED INCOME CREDITS.
 *
 * The federal EITC is modelled; the states that add their own on top were not,
 * so the households least able to absorb a wrong answer were the ones getting
 * one. Most states set theirs as a flat percentage of the federal credit, which
 * makes it straightforward once the federal figure exists.
 *
 * ONLY WHERE SOURCES AGREE. NCSL (May 2026), the IRS's own list and ITEP's 2025
 * appendix disagree on several states — Massachusetts reads 30% or 40%
 * depending which you open, Vermont and Virginia and DC are all mid-change.
 * Anything where two independent sources do not match is left out rather than
 * guessed, which is the same rule the head-of-household table follows.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY ABSENT and why:
 *   CA, MN, WA   own formulas, not a percentage of the federal credit at all
 *   DE           taxpayer chooses between a refundable and a larger
 *                nonrefundable credit, and this engine cannot make that choice
 *   MA, VT, VA   sources disagree or the credit is mid-change
 *   DC           85% in 2025 rising to 100%, and the sources differ on when
 *   OR           9%, or 12% with a child under three; this site never asks a
 *                child's age, so the lower figure would be a guess either way
 *
 * REFUNDABILITY MATTERS MORE THAN THE PERCENTAGE for this audience. A
 * refundable credit pays out below zero tax; a nonrefundable one stops at zero
 * and is worth nothing to a household that already owes nothing, which is
 * exactly the household it is aimed at.
