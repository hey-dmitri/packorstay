/**
 * The whole calculation: one city, then the other, then the difference.
 *
 * ORDER OF OPERATIONS IS LOAD-BEARING. Each step below feeds the next, and
 * getting the sequence wrong is the single most common way a relocation
 * calculator produces a confident wrong answer:
 *
 *   1. Living costs    national basket re-priced by metro, sales tax included
 *   2. Housing         produces property tax and first-year mortgage interest,
 *                      and takes the utility slice step 1 hands it
 *   3. State tax       depends on salary and filing status
 *   4. Local tax       Yonkers levies a surcharge ON the state liability
 *   5. Federal tax     state + local + property tax feed the SALT deduction,
 *                      which decides whether itemising beats the standard
 *                      deduction, which changes federal tax
 *   6. Sales tax       nothing to add — see that step for why it is zero
 *   7. Leftover        salary minus everything above
 *
 * Computing federal tax before state tax would silently ignore the deduction
 * and overstate federal liability in every high-tax state.
 *
 * Living costs lead because of the utility bill: a renter's Census gross rent
 * already contains gas, electricity, water and heating, and an owner's mortgage
 * contains none of them, so the basket has to hand that slice to housing before
 * housing can total itself.
 *
 * Steps 3-5, and FICA with them, run once PER TAX RETURN rather than once per
 * household — a couple filing separately files two. See taxReturnsFor. Housing
 * and living costs are properties of the home, so they are computed once
 * whatever the household does with its paperwork.
