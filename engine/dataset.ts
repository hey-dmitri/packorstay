 * chosen by its floor, so the basket jumped the instant a salary crossed a
 * published boundary. The justification on record was that interpolating would
 * "imply a precision the survey does not have". That argument is backwards. A
 * step function does not express uncertainty about spending — it asserts,
 * confidently and falsely, that spending is flat across a $50,000 band and then
 * leaps in a single dollar. What it actually produced:
 *
 *   $149,999 -> $150,000   Chicago leftover fell $8,300 for a $1 raise
 *   $199,999 -> $200,000   Chicago leftover fell $14,839 for a $1 raise
 *
 * And because the two cities sit at different price levels, the jumps did not
 * cancel: a $1 edit moved the gap between them by $614 at $150,000 and $1,119
 * at $200,000. That is enough to flip a verdict, and it made disposable income
 * fall as pay rose, which is not a thing that happens.
 *
 * THE FIX IS TO PUT EACH BRACKET WHERE IT BELONGS. A bracket's published mean
 * spending is the average over households spread across the whole bracket, so
 * it describes that bracket's mean INCOME, not its floor. Anchor each profile
 * at its mean income, interpolate between neighbours, and spending becomes a
 * continuous rising function of salary. No smoothing, no invention — the same
 * nine published points, read at the income they were measured at.
 *
 * Below the lowest mean and above the highest, the nearest profile is held
 * flat rather than extrapolated. The top bracket is open-ended, and its mean
