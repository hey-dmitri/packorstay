/**
 * Local (city and county) income tax.
 *
 * Only about ten states permit it, but where it exists it is large enough to
 * change a relocation decision — New York City alone adds roughly 3.9% on top
 * of New York State, which is the single biggest reason this app works at
 * metro rather than state level (PROJECT.md D1).
 *
 * Every real US local income tax fits one of three shapes:
 *
 *   bracketed       own progressive schedule on taxable income   (New York City)
 *   flatRate        flat percentage of wages                     (Philadelphia,
 *                                                                 Ohio cities,
 *                                                                 Maryland counties,
 *                                                                 Detroit)
 *   stateSurcharge  percentage of the STATE tax already computed (Yonkers)
 *
 * The surcharge form is why this runs after state tax and before federal:
 * it needs the state liability as an input, and its own output feeds SALT.
