/**
 * Share links: the entire comparison, encoded into the URL.
 *
 * There is no database and no server-side state (PROJECT.md D7). A link carries
 * everything needed to reproduce a result, which is what makes links free,
 * permanent, and private — nobody's salary is ever stored anywhere.
 *
 * WHY THE DATASET VERSION IS IN THE PAYLOAD
 *
 * If a link carried only the inputs, refreshing the dataset would silently
 * change every previously shared link. Someone opening your link next year
 * would see different numbers than you saw, with no indication anything had
 * moved. Pinning the version means a link recomputes against the data it was
 * created with — the same inputs, the same tables, the same answer, forever.
 *
 * ENCODING
 *
 * A compact binary format rather than JSON, because a JSON payload for this
 * would run to several hundred characters and wrap in emails. Values are
 * varints, then base64url. A typical renting comparison lands around 40
 * characters; owning on both sides, around 60.
 *
 * The format carries its own version byte, so an old link can always be
 * recognised — and rejected honestly rather than mis-decoded — if the layout
 * ever changes.

 *
 * When only New York City and Yonkers had a "do you live inside it?" question,
 * two entries were the whole story. Then eleven more metros were given a
 * grouped "Where in this metro do you live?" — Philadelphia, Pittsburgh,
 * Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, Detroit, Baltimore, Kansas City, St. Louis,
 * Louisville and Portland — and none of those answers had anywhere to go in
 * the link. Nothing failed. The encoder simply had no bit for them.
 *
 * What the reader got: `resolveLocalJurisdictions` finds no chosen member of
 * the group and falls back to `defaultApplies`, which is always the CITY rate.
 * So somebody who said they live outside Philadelphia, shared the result, and
 * opened their own link was shown the city tax anyway — $990 became $3,738,
 * their leftover fell by $2,747.50, and the verdict moved by the same amount.
 * The share bar promises "whoever opens it sees exactly these numbers".
 *
 * Appending is safe for links already in the wild. Their masks only ever set
 * bits 0 and 1; every new bit reads as false, and false is not a choice — the
 * grouped resolver treats only an explicit `true` as a selection and otherwise
 * falls back to the default, which is exactly what those links did before.
